## SignalR Ports

SignalR is an open-source library that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to apps. Real-time web functionality enables server-side code to push content to clients instantly.

Historically it was tied to ASP.NET Core but the [protocol](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/tree/master/src/SignalR/docs/specs) is open and implementable in any language.

To date, this protocol spec has been used to implement more clients, but it's possible to also implement servers in other languages. This repository
exists for that reason.
